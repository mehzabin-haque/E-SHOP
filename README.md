# E-Commerce Platform with Design Patterns

This e-commerce platform is implemented in Java and incorporates three design patterns to enhance its functionality and maintainability: Strategy, Mediator, and Template Method.

## Design Patterns Used

### 1. Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern is employed to handle different payment methods during the purchase process. By using this pattern, users can choose their preferred payment method, making the platform more versatile and accommodating to various payment options.

### 2. Mediator Pattern

The Mediator pattern is utilized to facilitate communication between product and user components. This approach promotes loose coupling between different components, improving maintainability and making it easier to expand or modify the platform's features.

### 3. Template Method Pattern

The Template Method pattern defines a standardized process for purchasing products, managing user accounts, and processing payments. Specific steps in this process can be overridden as needed, allowing for customization while maintaining a consistent structure throughout the platform.

## Technologies Used

The e-commerce platform is developed using Java, a robust and widely used programming language that provides a strong foundation for building scalable and reliable applications.

## Conclusion

By incorporating the Strategy, Mediator, and Template Method design patterns, this e-commerce platform becomes more flexible, scalable, and maintainable. Users can choose from different payment methods, communication between components is streamlined, and a standardized process ensures a seamless shopping experience. The application serves as a foundation for building an efficient and adaptable e-commerce solution for various businesses.

Contributions from the open-source community are welcomed to enhance and expand the platform further, making it a comprehensive and robust solution for e-commerce needs.
